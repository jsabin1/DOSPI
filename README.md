The Physical Interface for DemocracyOS

A free tool to allow users to have complete democratic control of their chosen candidate for any government. 
A representative on behalf of the users needs to physically sign up as a candidate to their respective governmental role and is activated on the system as an admin.
Users get full transparancy of the representative via the application and are required to vote on any significant decision the representative will encounter.

The concept is to create an abstraction from current governments into a platform whereby users must execute their democratic rights through the platform instead.

Spec needs:

1. user signup (can we use DemocracyOS' auth?)
2. user view
3. representative view
4. voting mechanism (DemocracyOS)
